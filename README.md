# ODFex
## Orientation Distribution Function Explorer
#### A simple visualization tool intended to help interpret or predict the azimuthal variation in X-ray powder diffraction data  
- 3D visualization of ODF (so far only fibre texture) in relation to the sample orientation  
- Visualization of the scattering vector $\vec{Q}$ and the contributing crystallite direction along the preferred orientation direction cone (POD)  
- Visualization of the azimuthal intensity variation of reflections at similar $2\theta$-values and their summed contribution  
- Easy drag-n-drop import of CIF files
